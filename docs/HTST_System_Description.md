# HTST Pasteurization System Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the High-Temperature Short-Time (HTST) pasteurization control system implemented using PLCopen XML and Structured Text programming. The system is designed to provide precise control of the pasteurization process, ensuring both product safety and quality.

## Process Description

HTST pasteurization is a method of food preservation that uses high temperature for a short time to kill microorganisms in liquid products. The typical process flow is:

1. **Raw Material Intake**: Product enters the system from a raw material tank.
2. **Pre-heating**: Product is pre-heated in a regenerative section of a heat exchanger.
3. **Heating**: Product is heated to pasteurization temperature (typically 72-75°C) in the heating section.
4. **Holding**: Product maintains pasteurization temperature for a specific time (typically 15-25 seconds) in the holding tube.
5. **Cooling**: Product is cooled in the regenerative and cooling sections of the heat exchanger.
6. **Forward Flow**: If temperature requirements are met, product flows to the next process.
7. **Flow Diversion**: If temperature requirements are not met, product is diverted back to the raw tank for reprocessing.

## Control System Architecture

The control system consists of:

1. **Temperature Control**: PID control for heating section temperature.
2. **Flow Control**: Controls product flow rate through the system.
3. **Flow Diversion**: Manages product routing based on temperature conditions.
4. **CIP (Clean-In-Place)**: Manages cleaning and sanitization of the system.
5. **Alarm Handling**: Monitors and responds to abnormal conditions.

## System Components

### Data Types

- **TemperatureSensor_t**: Structured data type for temperature sensors.
- **FlowMeter_t**: Structured data type for flow measurement.
- **Valve_t**: Structured data type for valve control and status.
- **ProcessState_t**: Enumeration of system states.
- **HTST_System_t**: Main system data structure.

### Function Blocks

- **FB_TemperatureControl**: PID temperature control.
- **FB_ValveControl**: Valve operation and monitoring.
- **FB_FlowControl**: Flow rate control.

### Programs

- **PRG_HTST_Main**: Main process control program.
- **PRG_HTST_CIP**: Clean-In-Place sequence control.
- **PRG_HTST_Alarms**: Alarm handling and management.

## States of Operation

The system operates in the following states:

1. **IDLE**: System is inactive, waiting for commands.
2. **STARTUP**: System is warming up and preparing for production.
3. **PREHEATING**: Product is being introduced at reduced flow while temperature stabilizes.
4. **PRODUCTION**: Normal pasteurization operations.
5. **CIP**: System is in cleaning mode.
6. **SHUTDOWN**: System is shutting down in a controlled manner.
7. **EMERGENCY**: Emergency stop activated, immediate shutdown.
8. **FAULT**: System fault detected.

## Process Parameters

### Temperature Control

- **Pasteurization Temperature**: 72°C (configurable)
- **Temperature Tolerance**: ±1.0°C
- **Minimum Legal Temperature**: 71.5°C

### Flow Control

- **Normal Flow Rate**: 100 L/min (configurable)
- **Holding Time**: Determined by flow rate and holding tube volume

## Alarms

- **High Temperature**: Product temperature exceeds upper limit.
- **Low Temperature**: Product temperature falls below minimum pasteurization temperature.
- **Low Flow**: Flow rate below minimum required for proper operation.
- **Low Pressure**: System pressure below minimum requirement.
- **Emergency Stop**: Emergency stop button activated.

## Clean-In-Place (CIP)

The CIP sequence consists of:

1. **Pre-rinse**: Initial rinse with water to remove product residue.
2. **Caustic Wash**: Cleaning with alkaline solution to remove fats and proteins.
3. **Intermediate Rinse**: Rinse to remove caustic solution.
4. **Acid Wash**: Cleaning with acid solution to remove mineral deposits.
5. **Final Rinse**: Thorough rinse to remove all cleaning chemicals.
6. **Sanitization**: Final sanitizing step before production.

## Visualization (HMI)

The HMI interface provides:

- **Process Overview**: Graphical representation of the HTST system.
- **Status Information**: Current temperatures, flow rates, and valve positions.
- **Controls**: System start/stop, parameter adjustment, CIP control.
- **Alarms**: Visual indicators of alarm conditions.

## Implementation Notes

This system is implemented using PLCopen XML format and Structured Text programming language according to IEC 61131-3 standards. The code can be imported into any compatible PLC development environment that supports PLCopen XML.
